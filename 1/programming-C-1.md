## Course Outcome

1. Learn the concepts of IT and understand the fundamentals of basic building blocks  of computer science.
2. Understand basic data types and syntax of C programming. . 
3. Propose solution to problem by using tools like algorithm and flowcharts.
4. Analyze and select best possible solution for decision-based problems using decision making skills.
5. Develop the aptitude to solve iterative problems using different types of looping statements.
6. Implement complex problem as a collection of sub problems by applying  modularization in applications using functions.
