## Course Outcome

1. Learn and apply concepts of strings for providing solutions to 
   homogenous collection of  data types
2. Propose solution to problem by using tools like algorithm and flowcharts.
3. Apply the concept of pointers to optimize memory management by 
   overcoming the limitations of arrays.
4. Process and analyze problems based on heterogeneous collection of 
   data using structures.
5. Apply concepts of file handling to implement data storage and 
   retrieval tasks.
6. Implement the basic real life problems using python
