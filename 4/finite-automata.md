## Course Outcome

1. Understand the importance of formal languages in design of Programming Languages
2. Develop students ability to appreciate mathematical proofs for 
   computations and algorithms
3. Identify different formal language classes and their relationships.
4. Analyze various decidable and undecidable problems of real world
5. Design solutions by proving or disprove theorems in automata theory 
   using its properties
6. Formulate finite machines, push down automata and Turing machines 
   for automated functioning of devices.
