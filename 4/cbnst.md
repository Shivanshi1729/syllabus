## Course Outcomes

1. Develop the notion of errors, finding of errors, roots and 
   apply them in problem solving in concern subject.
2. Use effectively interpolation techniques and use them for 
   numerical differentiation and integration.
3. Interpret asymptotic notation, its significance, and be 
   able to use it to analyse asymptotic performance for basic 
   algorithmic examples.
4. Examine statistical control techniques and be able to relate 
   these to practical examples.
5. Elaborate the basics of regression, curve fitting and be 
   able to apply the methods from these subjects in problem solving.
6. Explain the concepts of numerical solutions of ordinary 
   differential equations.
