## Course Outcome

1. Understand the basic components of a computer and milestones 
   in their historical development.
2. Discuss the operation of the arithmetic unit including the 
   algorithms & implementation of fixed-point and floating-point 
   addition, subtraction, multiplication & division.
3. Have a clear understanding of the elements of CPU working and 
   Instruction Set Architecture
4. Identify the impact of the hierarchical memory system including 
   cache memories and virtual on the overall computer system design
5. Evaluate the various aspects I/O operations and their impact 
   on the overall performance and functioning of computers
6. Review the current trends in development of processor architectures 
   with emphasis on instruction level parallelism, latency operations 
   in pipeline design, fault tolerance etc.
