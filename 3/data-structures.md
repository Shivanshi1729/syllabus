## Course Outcomes

1. Describe the concept of Data Structures and assess how the choice of 
   data structures impacts the performance of programs
2. Compare and contrast merits and demerits of various data structures 
   in terms of time and memory complexity.
3. Identify and propose appropriate data structure for providing the 
   solution to the real world problems.
4. Implement operations like searching, insertion, deletion,
   traversing mechanism etc. on various data structures
5. Be familiar with advanced data structures such as balanced search
   trees, hash tables, AVL trees, priority queues, ADT etc.
6. To augment merits of particular data structures on other data 
   structure to develop innovation in subject of study.
