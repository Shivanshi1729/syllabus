## Course Outcomes

1. Be able to specify and manipulate basic mathematical objects 
   such as sets, functions, and relations . Demonstrate an 
   understanding of partial order relations and Lattices.

   theory, and be able to apply the methods from these subjects 
   in problem solving.
3. Produce convincing arguments, conceive and/or analyze basic 
   mathematical proofs and discriminate between valid and unreliable arguments.
4. Discriminate, identify and prove the properties of groups and subgroups
5. Be able to apply basic counting techniques to solve combinatorial problems
