## Course Outcome

1. Understand the object oriented approach by implementing various streams, 
   classes, member functions and objects.
2. Implement dynamic memory management techniques using object pointers, 
   constructors, destructors and apply them to real world problems
3. Solve  function overloading, operator overloading that binds the 
   concept of compile time polymorphism
4. Apply inheritance at various levels incorporating virtual and pure 
   virtual functions.
5. Carry out exception handling techniques and provide solutions to 
   storage related problems using STL.
6. Construct advance features like   generic programming that can be 
   used to solve the problems related to code reusability
