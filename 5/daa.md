## Course Outcome

1. Discuss various asymptotic notations to analyze time and 
   space complexity of algorithms
2. Analyze the various paradigms for designing efficient 
   algorithms using concepts of design and conquer,
   greedy and dynamic programming techniques
3. Provide solutions to complex problems using the concept 
   of back tracking and branch and bound techniques.
4. Apply algorithm design techniques to predict the complexity 
   of certain NP complete problems.
5. Implement Dijkstra’s, Bellman-ford, Prims, Kruskal’s algorithms 
   to solve the real world problems like traveling salesman problem,
   job sequencing, packet routing etc
6. Apply pattern matching algorithms like Rabin Karp Algorithm, 
   Brute-force techniques etc to find a particular pattern.
